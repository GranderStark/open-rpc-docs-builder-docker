# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

 How do I make a good changelog?
 Guiding Principles:
 - Changelogs are for humans, not machines.
 - There should be an entry for every single version.
 - The same types of changes should be grouped.
 - The latest version comes first.
 - The release date of each version is displayed.
 
 Types of changes:
 - `### Added` for new features.
 - `### Changed` for changes in existing functionality.
 - `### Deprecated` for soon-to-be removed features.
 - `### Removed` for now removed features.
 - `### Fixed` for any bug fixes.
 - `### Security` in case of vulnerabilities.
